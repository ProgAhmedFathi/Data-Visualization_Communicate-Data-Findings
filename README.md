# Data Visualization - Communicate Data Findings
#### 4th project in the [egFWD scholarship](https://egfwd.com) for Data Analysis Nanodegree Program from Udacity.
<ins>These projects REVIEWED by Udacity reviewers (real persons) according to Project Rubricand, and the projects MUST "meet specifications" or "exceed specifications" in each category in order for my submission to pass.</ins>

## About the project
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process:
- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## The Dataset
You can find the dataset which I used in the files of the repo with name "Students' Academic Performance Dataset.csv".

### Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process:
- **Exploratory** data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.
- **Explanatory** data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

## What I learned?
After completing this project, I able to:
- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.

## Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
In this first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choice. Use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns, and relationships.

The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships to multivariate relationships, but it does not need to be clean or perfect. There is no single answer that needs to come out of a given dataset. This part of the project is your opportunity to ask questions about the data and make your discoveries. It’s essential to keep in mind that sometimes exploration can lead to dead ends and that it can take multiple steps to dig down to what you’re genuinely looking for. Be patient with your steps, document your work carefully, and be thorough in the perspective that you choose to take with your dataset.
